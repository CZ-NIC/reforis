            Here you can configure the settings of the network interfaces on your device. You can switch the physical
            network interfaces among networks. If you are unsure what to set here use the default settings.

            <h4>WAN</h4>
            It acts as an external network connection. Firewall rules should be applied here. It can only contain a
            single interface.

            <h4>LAN</h4>
            It acts as a local network connection. LAN should contain devices which are under your control and you
            trust them. These devices can see each other and can access this web interface. It is recommended that the
            LAN should contain at least one interface otherwise you might not be able to configure this device in an
            easy way.

            <h4>Guest network</h4>
            It acts as a local network connection. Unlike LAN the devices in the guest network can't access
            the configuration interface of this device and are only able to access WAN (internet). This network should
            be used for devices which you don't fully trust. Note that you can also limit download/upload speed of the
            devices connected to the guest network.
