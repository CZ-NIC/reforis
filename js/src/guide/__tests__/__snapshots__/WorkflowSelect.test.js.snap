  <p>
    Here you can set the guide walkthrough which will guide you through the basic configuration of your device.

      <h3>
        Router
      </h3>
      <button
        class="btn btn-outline-secondary"

        <img
          alt="router"
          src="/static/reforis/imgs/workflow-router.svg"
        />
      </button>
      <p>
        After you finish this workflow your device will be able to act as a fully functional router. It assumes that you want to have more or less standard network setup.

      <h3>
        Local server
      </h3>
      <button
        class="btn btn-outline-secondary"

        <img
          alt="bridge"

        />
      </button>
      <p>
        This workflow will help you to setup your device to act as a local server. It means that the device will provide some kind of service to other devices within your local network (e.g. act as a network-attached storage).
